Generate clusters for individual data sets before integration.\
File names explain the data set being worked on - 
1. DiffDays_DiffDepth - F1 data set (PBMC)
2. DiffDays_SameDepth - H1 data set (PBMC)
3. SameBatch_DiffTiss - BM and PBMC sequenced in the same batch
4. SameBatch_SameTissue - 3 PBMC samples sequenced in the same batch

Note: Liger workflow generates the clusters and dataset plots. Converted Seurat object to Liger before processing.
