Generate clusters for individual data sets before integration.\
File names explain the data set being worked on - 
1. DiffDays_DiffDepth - F1 data set (PBMC)
2. DiffDays_SameDepth - H1 data set (PBMC)
3. DiffTiss_SameBatch - BM and PBMC sequenced in the same batch
4. SameDays_SameDepth - 3 PBMC samples sequenced in the same batch

Note: "v1" indicates that the samples have been merged for analysis in the code.
